I'll break down the estimated monthly costs for each Azure service in our architecture and explain what drives these costs:

1. **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) - ~$70-100/month**
   - Basic node pool with 1 Standard_DS2_v2 VM: ~$70
   - Contains:
     - 2 vCPUs
     - 7 GB RAM
     - Managed disk
   - Cost factors:
     - Number of nodes
     - VM size
     - Uptime (can be reduced by stopping during non-development hours)

2. **Cosmos DB - ~$0-50/month**
   - Using serverless configuration
   - Costs based on:
     - Request Units (RUs) consumed
     - Storage used
   - Free tier includes:
     - 1000 RU/s
     - 25GB storage
   - Development usage typically stays within free tier

3. **Azure Storage Account - ~$5-20/month**
   - Hot tier storage for:
     - Raw data
     - Processed data
     - ML models
   - Costs based on:
     - Amount of data stored
     - Number of operations
     - Data transfer
   - Free tier includes some storage and operations

4. **Azure Key Vault - ~$0-5/month**
   - Free tier includes:
     - 7,500 operations/month
     - Basic secrets management
   - Additional costs for:
     - HSM-backed keys (not needed for development)
     - High-volume operations

5. **Azure ML Workspace - ~$40-100/month**
   - Compute costs for:
     - Training jobs
     - Model deployment
   - Storage for:
     - Datasets
     - Model artifacts
   - Can reduce costs by:
     - Using spot instances
     - Stopping compute when not in use
     - Using free compute credits

6. **Application Insights - ~$0-10/month**
   - Free tier includes:
     - 5GB ingestion
     - 31-day retention
   - Costs based on:
     - Data ingestion volume
     - Data retention period

7. **Azure Functions (if used) - ~$0-5/month**
   - Free tier includes:
     - 1 million executions
     - Consumption plan
   - Costs based on:
     - Number of executions
     - Execution time
     - Memory used

Cost Optimization Strategies:
1. Development Environment:
   - Shut down AKS cluster during non-working hours
   - Use spot instances for ML training
   - Implement auto-shutdown policies

2. Resource Scaling:
   - Start with minimum configurations
   - Scale up only when needed
   - Monitor usage patterns

3. Free Tier Usage:
   - Leverage free tiers for all services
   - Stay within free tier limits during development
   - Use consumption-based pricing where possible

4. Development vs Production:
   - Development: ~$200-300/month
   - Production: Could increase to $500-1000/month depending on:
     - Traffic volume
     - Data processing needs
     - Availability requirements
     - Redundancy needs

Would you like me to:
1. Provide more detail about specific service configurations?
2. Explain how to monitor and optimize costs?
3. Create cost estimation for different scaling scenarios?
